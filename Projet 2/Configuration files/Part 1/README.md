# Remarks
The first part of the project was only to make the network and configure the intial steps of the server. So some other configuration i added and the other devices added in future part will be in the folder under part 2. Also for some reason I don't have the last version of the configuration file because i probably troubleshooted on the real equipement so there might be some errors in some configuration file but it is probably 99% functionnal.
